# HistoryCleaner
Firefox addon that deletes history older than a specified amount of days.

This addon is inspired by and is a WebExtension port of [Expire History By Days](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/expire-history-by-days/).

Set the number of days to keep history items in the options page. Setting it to 0 will disable history deletion. The deletion will occur when the browser goes idle (after about 1 minute of inactivity).

The icon is from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
