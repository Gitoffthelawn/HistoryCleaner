v1.7.0 Changelog

* Add option to clear download history.
* Add option to change icon.
* Download and Notification permissions are now again.

[Chrome]

* Change default icon.
* Disable theme icon, as theme icons aren't supported in Chrome.
* [Known Issue] The optional permission checkboxes close the popup in Chrome. They *should* work as expected, but you may want to toggle them from `chrome://extensions` instead.
